# Object-Oriented Programming in Java – Course Assignments  

This repository contains Java programming assignments for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Each lesson includes a coding task that demonstrates key OOP principles and best practices.  

## 📁 Repository Structure  

The project follows a structured organization to keep assignments well-organized:  

- **`src/`** – Contains all source code files.  
  - Each assignment is stored in a separate subfolder named using the format: `aulaYYYYMMDD` (e.g., `aula20250212`).  
- **`lib/`** – Stores external dependencies, if required.  
- **`bin/`** – Contains compiled output files.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

To run the assignments locally, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/flaviasoares/Atividades-POO.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in VS Code** (or any Java-compatible IDE).  
3. **Ensure Java is installed** (`JDK 17+` recommended).  
4. **Compile and run the Java files** using:  
   ```sh
   javac src/aulaYYYYMMDD/applications/Program.java
   java -cp src aulaYYYYMMDD.Program
   ```

## 🔧 Development Setup  

For an optimized development experience, consider using:  

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** with the Java Extension Pack.    

## 📌 Notes  

- Each assignment is designed to reinforce OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.  
- Code improvements and optimizations are welcome—feel free to contribute!
